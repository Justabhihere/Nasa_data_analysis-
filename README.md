# NASA Battery Aging Analysis Project

## Overview

This Flask-based web application visualizes **NASA battery aging data** using interactive line charts generated by Plotly. The graphs analyze parameters such as:
1. **Electrolyte Resistance (Re)**
2. **Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct)**
3. **Battery Capacity**

The graphs display the variations over **Cycle Index** with a **dark theme** and color-coded lines:
- **White Lines** for Capacity and Resistance
- **Green Lines** for additional clarity

The app highlights peaks and lows in the data, enabling users to analyze trends effectively.
